# Vacation-Manager
This is my Second year C++ project i had created.
My basic idea of a vacation manager is to empower the traveler with instant booking and
comprehensive choices, the company began its journey in the US-India travel market.
It aimed to offer a range of best-value products and services along with cutting-edge
technology and dedicated round-the-clock customer support.

Vacation rentals can range from budget studio apartments to lavish, expensive private
villas in the world&#39;s most desirable locations, some with price tags of many thousands
per night and all the amenities you would find in any luxury accommodation (fully
staffed, private beaches, boats, chefs, cooking lessons, etc.) to cater to the guests.

Plus we could add in even more extra benefits for your trip like discounts on food or
shopping coupons or an extra night stay in your favorite hotel or even a free pass to
your destination.
